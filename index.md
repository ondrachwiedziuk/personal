# About Me

![Ondřej Chwiedziuk](/assets/images/ondra-square.png){: .profile-image}

Hi! I'm Ondřej Chwiedziuk, and this is my personal website on the web where I share my interests, projects, and other random stuff.

I study masters mathematical structures at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in Prague. My particular interests include algebraic combinatorics, representation theory and topological methods in combinatorics. On my bachelor's thesis I worked on the characterisation of quandles which yield a trivial coloring knot invariant under supervision of [David Stanovský](https://www.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~stanovsk/).

Beside that, I enjoy programming of small projects, mainly in Python, but also in Rust and other languages.

I am a long term member of Spolek Matfyzák, where I currently serve as a náčelník (chairman), and an organizer of mathematical competition called Náboj and a computer science competition called ZISK. Beside this, I also help with organizing the Spring school of the Department of Algebra at Charles University.

In last few years, I have been cooking on several summer camps, including KSP, PraSe and Iksko. I collected some of my recipes and cooking experiences in the [Recipes](/recipes/) section.

I also like to travel, and I have been to several countries in Europe, from which I have some photos, which I decided to share in the [Photos](/photos/) section. I have also been in the United States for a one and half months, and I took part in Erasmus+ program in the Padua, Italy, where I studied for one semester.

Notes, insights, and resources from my ongoing learning journey. It also includes courses I have taught or assisted with, and resources for students.

### <span class="button">[Research](/research/)</span>
My research interests, findings, and academic work.

### <span class="button">[Projects](/projects/)</span>
A showcase of my not only programming projects I was working on.

### <span class="button">[Photos](/photos/)</span>
Photos of places I have visited which I decided to share.

### <span class="button">[Recipes](/recipes/)</span>
Some of my recipes, it is written as a Python code snippets, which, someday, you will be able to run and it will compute the amount of ingredients you need for the number of servings you want to cook, but now it is in progress.
