This page is part of the tutorial for the course Mathematics++ ([NMAI071](https://is.cuni.cz/studium/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=NMAI071)), held at 17:20 in S10. The [lecture](https://kam.mff.cuni.cz/Matematika++/) is given by [Martin Tancer](https://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~tancer/) and [Robert Šámal](https://iuuk.mff.cuni.cz/~samal/).

# Credit requirements

Every two or three weeks, a homework assignment will be published in [Postal Owl](https://owl.mff.cuni.cz/join/c17aa51478df) (Token: c17aa51478df). Each assignment will have a deadline three weeks later and will be worth up to 20 points. After two weeks, hints will be published; however, the maximum number of points obtainable will then be halved. There will be four homework sessions in total, with a maximum of 80 points.

To obtain credit for the course, you need to earn at least 25 points out of 80. You can also obtain grade 1 by earning at least 60 points.

Each homework must be solved individually; cooperation is discouraged. Searching for solutions online or asking large language models (LLMs) to solve the problems is prohibited. You may use facts from bachelor-level courses, lectures from this course, and the recommended literature, but any deeper results taken from books must be properly cited. If you wish to use a theorem from another book, you are also required to prove it.

You may submit your solutions in Postal Owl repeatedly, and they will be corrected as soon as possible. You may also be asked to present your solution during a tutorial session if something is unclear.
