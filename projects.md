I have worked on the following projects. These can be either smaller projects that I worked on alone, or larger ones that require team collaboration and whose development is still ongoing.

## Sportmatiq

A website where you can find predictions for various sports disciplines. Currently, it's a beta version that contains only football leagues, but a full version will be launched soon, which will include not only predictions for other sports, such as hockey or basketball, but also lots of data for given leagues, such as results of previous matches, lineups and more. It will also contain a forum so people can share their experiences and insights. My work here is data analysis and database interaction. I also manage company emails.

## ZISK

ZISK (Fun Informatics Super Competition) is a correspondence seminar in computer science, aimed at high school students and undergraduate students not only in computer science. It is an advanced seminar that targets experienced programmers and is not suitable for complete beginners. There are many problems here that try to cover the most diverse parts of computer science. I participate in creating and testing problems and I'm also a cook and organizer of camps.

## K-lighter

A syntax highlighter for the not-so-programming language K, whose free implementation you can find [here](https://github.com/ktye/i). It takes as input a file containing a script in K and returns HTML with colored code according to the chosen template.

## Tombolenkovaƒç

A Python command-line tool for managing tombola (raffle) events. It allows you to create prize lists, generate PDF tickets with unique numbers, draw winning tickets, and verify if a ticket is a winner. The tool is designed to handle the complete workflow of organizing raffles, from setup to prize distribution. It's available as a PyPI package and can be easily installed and used for events, fundraisers, or any situation where you need a fair and organized way to conduct drawings.

## Spring school KA

A website for the traditional seminar of the Department of Algebra at Charles University's Faculty of Mathematics and Physics. The event brings together students,  staff, and guests for academic presentations in English covering topics in algebra, geometry, logic, cryptography, and number theory, combined with outdoor activities in nature. As one of the organizers, I help coordinate the event and co-created this website to manage registrations, present the program, and showcase the event's history spanning over a decade.
